# Examples for Writing Your Own Grammar

This repo includes:
 
* **Trees Please**: a LISP implementation I wrote at SFPC & Recurse Center. This example has a fairly robust interpreter, including scoping. This example was written to be used from a web REPL.

* **Whenever.js**: a quick implementation of the esolang [Whenever](http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/whenever.html). Expected statements are Javascript functions or Whenever-style statement manipulation.[See, for example, this Friday Pathalogical Programmming article.](http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2006/07/28/friday-pathological-programmin-1/) For more details, see README in `whenver.js` directory. This example includes a command-line interface.

* A blank example for you start jamming on.

Also check out:
* the code behind [ComicStripScript](https://github.com/yukiy/ComicStripScript) to get a feel for generating images and `canvas` objects from a grammar
* Ramsey Nasser's [Rejoyce implementations](https://github.com/nasser/rejoyce), for the stack approach
