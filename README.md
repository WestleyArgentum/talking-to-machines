# Talking to Machines (Those A**Holes)

In this class, we will discuss what it means to envision speaking to machines as a special case of using language as opposed to a special case of math or magical incantations. We will explore the artistic and aesthetic possibilities of creating our own distoring languages.

### Timeline
##### Day 1: Talking to Machines, PLT Through the Ages
* Discuss the history of PLT & talking to machines, including esolangs
* On Distortion, Exercises in Style
* Learn about parsing expression grammars
* Set Up tools

##### Day 2: Making Our Own
* Working alone or in teams to make a distortion language with either [PLTJS](https://github.com/nasser/pltjs) or [Ohm](https://github.com/cdglabs/ohm)

### Pre-Class Resources
If you aren't familiar with basic programming concepts, particularly in Javascript, I'd recommend taking the time to do the basic [Codecademy Javascript track](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript) or the [Code School lessons](https://www.codeschool.com/paths/javascript).

If you'd like to read about esolangs and just get really excited, check out: [Esoteric.codes](http://esoteric.codes/), Daniel Temkin's blog, or the [Esolangs Wiki](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Main_Page) and [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code)
